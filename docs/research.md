# Initial research

Before creating this tool, we searched in vain for existing solutions.

Variations of these queries have been made on Google, Reddit, StackOverflow, GitHub and Quora:

* all user repos
* all github repos user pushed
* all github commits for a user
* all github contributions per user
* github contribs

We have browsed the following GitHub topics:

* [github-user](https://github.com/topics/github-user)
* [github-contributions](https://github.com/topics/github-contributions)
* [github-repos](https://github.com/topics/github-repos)
